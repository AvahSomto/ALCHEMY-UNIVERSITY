## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The tools, frameworks, packages, and libraries used in this project are Node.js, Express.js, Ethereum-cryptography, 
React, Vite, Axios, Sass. The code should run with no issues using Node.js 20 *. The platform used was VS Code.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

I want to enhance the security of fund transfers within a decentralized system so I applied 
digital signatures and public key cryptography to ensure that only the authorized user, 
who possesses the appropriate private key, can create a valid signature to authorize fund transfers.
My approach adds a layer of security to the system and enables the verification of the sender's ownership of the private key, 
thereby enhancing the overall security and integrity of fund transfers.
   

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are two folders available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  
The first folder 'client' while the second folder 'server'.  Another folder added was 'scripts' and is found in the server folder. 

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of this project includes:
1. Implementation of digital signatures: The successful integration of digital signatures to ensure that fund transfers
can only be initiated with a valid signature from the authorized user.
2. Enhanced security: By incorporating public key cryptography, the project should result in an enhanced level of security for
fund transfers, as only the rightful owner of the private key can authorize transactions.
3. Verification of ownership: The system should require the sender to verify that they own the private key corresponding to the
address from which the funds are being sent, thereby adding an additional layer of security.
4. Secure fund transfers: The end result should be a system where fund transfers can only be completed with a
valid signature and proper verification of ownership, ensuring the integrity and security of the transfer process.
